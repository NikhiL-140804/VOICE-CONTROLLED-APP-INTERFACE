DESCRIPTION:As part of Task 4 of my internship, I was assigned to design a user interface for a Smart Home app that functions through voice interactions. The goal was to simulate a modern, voice-controlled environment where the user can control various smart home devices such as lights, thermostats, and more using natural language commands. For this project, I used Figma, a cloud-based design and prototyping tool that allowed me to create an interactive, component-based UI and simulate voice interactions using frames, transitions, and annotations. Figma was the ideal tool for this task due to its intuitive layout system, collaborative features, and support for creating clean, scalable design systems with real-time preview and prototyping support.

The design began with a home screen that welcomes the user and provides a quick overview of connected devices. The most prominent feature is a microphone button, which acts as the central action for initiating a voice command. This button is placed prominently and animated with a Lottie-style wave interaction, symbolizing real-time voice capture. Upon pressing the mic button, the user is taken to the voice input screen, where a listening animation is displayed. From there, I designed a response flow screen where the app shows feedback such as “Turning off the living room lights” or “Setting the temperature to 22°C.” These interaction transitions were created in Figma using smart animate and instant transitions between frames to simulate real app flow.

Beyond voice control feedback, I also designed dedicated screens for controlling smart thermostats, including a temperature dial, energy-saving status, and device toggles. Each UI element is designed with a clean, modern aesthetic using soft shadows, rounded components, and calm color tones like deep blue and soft gray to give the interface a futuristic but friendly feel. Icons were sourced from Figma plugins and styled consistently to create a coherent experience. The typography used throughout is minimal and legible, primarily using the Poppins font for headers and UI text, maintaining a consistent visual language across all screens.

To demonstrate voice interaction logic, I annotated flows between screens to simulate user voice prompts like “Turn off lights,” “Check room temperature,” or “Switch on the fan,” followed by a visual transition to the respective response screen. These voice prompts were mapped into logical flows within the Figma prototype settings, simulating how a voice assistant-driven interface would work. All screens were aligned in a structured frame flow, using Figma’s auto-layout and alignment tools for consistency and scalability.

This task helped me gain hands-on experience with voice-first UX design, which is becoming increasingly relevant in smart home and wearable technology. I learned how to guide users through voice interactions with minimal UI, provide clear feedback, and ensure usability even in screen-light experiences. Overall, Task 4 allowed me to explore modern interaction design principles, prototype immersive flows, and present a polished smart home experience through voice, completing the final phase of my design internship.
